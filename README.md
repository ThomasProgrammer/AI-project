## Summary

This AI powered aplication should recognize minerals and rocks. It should be a mobile aplication which takes a photo and with some aditional information it should recognize which rock or mineral is it.

## Background

This AI powered application solve these problems:
* help teaching geology in schools
* provide recognizing of rocks to all people

## Data sources and AI methods
I will collect data from institutions which specializes on geology.

## Challenges

There are too many kinds of rocks and minerals. It is not possible to cover all of them.

## What next?

This project could be improved by adding more data into it.


## Acknowledgments

Thanks to Building AI massive online open course, which inspires me to study AI methods and gives me really helpfull knowledge.
